- Removed keys from PhoneGap.plist (AutoRotate, StartOrientation, RotateOrientation).
- To support orientation in your app: edit/add the UISupportedInterfaceOrientations (iPhone) or UISupportedInterfaceOrientations~ipad (iPad) key into your app's [appname]-Info.plist, with an array of strings that show what orientation your app supports. The supported values are: UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait, UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft, UIInterfaceOrientationPortraitUpsideDown, UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight. 
- The first value in the array is the orientation that your app starts in. If you have more than one value in the array, it will autorotate (to the other supported orientations).
