Thanks for installing PhoneGapLib!

To get started creating PhoneGap projects, launch Xcode, then under the File menu, select "New Project...".

Navigate to the "User Templates" section, select PhoneGap, then in the right pane, select "PhoneGap-based Application"

Select the "Choose..." button, name your project and choose the location where you want the new project to be.

That's it! Modify the contents of the "www" directory to add your HTML, CSS and Javascript.

iPad:
Go to your project folder and launch the "[projectname]-iPad" Xcode project. You will need the 3.2 iPhone OS SDK.
